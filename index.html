           <ul>
               <li class="fragment">This is used when you first create a file. Before you have saved it the first time, your file generally has the name "untitled1" or “Document1”. You must save a file in order to be able to retrieve it again at a later date.</li>

            <p class="fragment">One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world is the function.</p>
            <p class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F">Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Functions are pieces of code that you can call over and over again.</p>

            <p>Programming Languages</p>
            <p class="fragment">Whether you know 4 commands of a language or hundreds, you will always be constrained by the programming language.</p> 
            <p class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F">The reason you need to learn how to program is because there isn’t a command to do every little thing; you have to understand the set of things that a programming language can do, and then use your creativity and problem-solving skills to get the computer to do what you want.</p>
